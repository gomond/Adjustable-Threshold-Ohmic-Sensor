# Adjustable Threshold Ohmic Sensor
 Adjustable Threshold Ohmic Sensor designed to operate with current Masso CNC Plasma
 I have added an enable override jumper so that ti will function with the current G200
 command and anticipate that, Masso in their wisdom will ad a configurable enable output pin function to
 the G200 in an upcomming release as this makes the device much safer again by allowing full gapped isolation 
 on top of the optical isolation. 
 I have also added a fuse to the design, that is up to the end user to decide on or just place a link.
 
 I have tested it on my machine and it works adequatly there is possibly a lot of room for improvement 
 and as such is public dommain so feel free to fork and alter it as you please.
 All parts for the prototype including the din mount enclosure are available from RS components.
